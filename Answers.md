1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

I think React JS was created by Facebook to allow programs to render
better and faster to the DOM. React JS also allows the developer to
create apps faster by utilizing component libraries and this allows for
less coding by the developer.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

When I think about react, I think about a component tree that passes
data around a react application via props or properties. The smart
components extract data from state and transmit the data to the dumb
components and is then rendered into HTML.

1. Describe state.

State is where the data retrieved to the smart components are stored
until the inputs are changed.

1. Describe props.

Props are the component properties passed down through the component
tree.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are unexpected responses caused by actions of certain
functions like get request, we use the useEffect hook to minimize side
effects.
